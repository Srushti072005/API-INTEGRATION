This task involves developing a simple web page that fetches and displays real-time weather information using a public API. The chosen API for this project is the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather data for any city around the world.

Objective:
Build an interactive web interface where users can input the name of a city and get the current weather details such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed.

Key Components:
HTML (Structure):

An input field for entering the city name.

A button to trigger the API request.

A container (div) to display the weather data.

CSS (Styling):

Simple styles for layout, fonts, buttons, and containers to enhance readability and appearance.

JavaScript (Logic):

Uses the fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

Parses the returned JSON data and extracts useful information.

Dynamically updates the webpage to show weather details.

Includes error handling for invalid city names or network issues.

API Integration:

Requires a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.

The API URL is constructed using the user-provided city name and API key.

Data is fetched in metric units (Celsius).

How It Works:
User enters a city name and clicks the “Get Weather” button.

A JavaScript function sends a request to the weather API.

The response includes details like weather description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

These details are shown dynamically on the web page.

Outcome:
A functional and responsive web page that demonstrates how to:

Use external public APIs.

Handle user input.

Dynamically update webpage content.

Manage asynchronous API calls using modern JavaScript.

This project is ideal for beginners learning web development and API integration.
